# Hello

This repo contains a collection of node scripts that I've created for various tasks. 
They're not very polished or stand-alone. However, I think many of these scripts could 
be useful as references for how to do certain common tasks.

# Setup

- Checkout the repo
- Run "npm install" in the directory

# Scripts

Here is an overview of the scripts. Each script should (eventually) have its own README with more detail.

- aws/s3/copy-bucket: Copies all objects from one Amazon S3 bucket to another.
- podcast/create: Create a valid podcast RSS feed out of a list of MP3s
